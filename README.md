There is 4 major branches in this projet :

master : contains model training script along-side an api for test

best-model-saver-with-pickle : if you like to re-generate the binary objects and save them by yourself.

classifier-test : for running winning features on multy classifiers

fake-identifier : beta program of triplets extractor

otherwise, a pre-saved binary model is already saved inside the api folder,
